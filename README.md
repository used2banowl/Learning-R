Learning R
================

## Setup

You’ll want to install the following prior to starting this course:

- [R and RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (there are other git GUIs
  that are good - my favorite is [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
  but I recommend starting here)
  - You’ll also need a [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) account to
    use Sourcetree (you can use both free of charge).
  - You may find [Setting up Sourcetree on Windows]() or [Setting up
    Sourcetree on a Mac]() helpful.

On a related note, if you are a student (i.e. if you must have a ‘.edu’
email and a student ID card), you should check out the [GitHub Student
Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). It comes with all
sorts of freebies and discounts for developer tools including things
like training, GitHub Pro, JetBrains, Microsoft Azure, Codespaces, and
GitKraken.

Once you have the required software, fork this repository and clone it
to your computer as described in [Setting up your computer for Learning
R]().
