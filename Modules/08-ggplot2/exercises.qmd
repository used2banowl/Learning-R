## Key Points

-   Use ggplot2 to create plots.
-   Think about graphics in layers: aesthetics, geometry, statistics, scale transformation, and grouping.
:::

```{r}
#| include: false
library(gapminder)
data(gapminder)

library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
theme_set(theme_cowplot())

# load colorblind friendly color paletts

```

#### Challenge 1

Modify the example so that the figure shows how life expectancy has changed over time:

<!-- Challenge 1 answer begin -->

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()
```

<!-- Challenge 1 answer end -->

#### Challenge 2

In the previous examples and challenge we've used the `aes` function to tell the scatterplot **geom** about the **x** and **y** locations of each point. Another *aesthetic* property we can modify is the point *color*. Modify the code from the previous challenge to **color** the points by the "continent" column. What trends do you see in the data? Are they what you expected?

<!-- Challenge 2 answer begin -->

```{r}
# you code goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 2 answer end -->

#### Challenge 3

Here is a demonstration of drawing points *on top of* lines.

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country)) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(color=continent)) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbbPalette)
```

Switch the order of the point and line layers from the previous example. What happened?

<!-- Challenge 3 answer begin -->

```{r}
# Your code goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 3 answer end -->

#### Challenge 4a

We can fit a simple relationship to the data by adding another layer, `geom_smooth`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", size=1.5)
```

Modify the color and size of the points on the point layer in the previous example.

Hint: do not use the `aes` function.

<!-- Challenge 4a answer begin -->

```{r}
# Your code goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 4a answer end -->

#### Challenge 4b

Modify your solution above so that the points are now a different shape and are colored by continent with new trendlines. Hint: The **color** argument can be used inside the aesthetic.

<!-- Challenge 4b answer begin -->

```{r}
# Your code goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 4b answer end -->

#### Challenge 5

1.  Generate boxplots to compare life expectancy between the different continents during the available years.
2.  Rename y axis as Life Expectancy.
3.  Remove x axis labels.

<!-- Challenge 5 answer begin -->

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 5 answer end -->
