## Key Points

-   Indexing in R starts at 1, not 0.
-   Access individual values by location using `[]`.
-   Access slices of data using `[low:high]`.
-   Access arbitrary sets of data using `[c(...)]`.
-   Use logical operations and logical vectors to access subsets of data.
:::

#### Challenge 1

Given the following code:

```{r}
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
print(x)
```

Come up with at least 2 different commands that will produce the following output using `x`:

```         
  b   c   d 
6.2 7.1 4.8 
```

<!-- Challenge 1 answer begin -->

```{r}
# your commands go here
```

<!-- Challenge 1 answer end -->

#### Challenge 2

Given the following code:

```{r}
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
print(x)
```

Write a subsetting command to return the values in x that are greater than 4 and less than 7.

<!-- Challenge 2 answer begin -->

```{r}
# your command goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 2 answer end -->

#### Challenge 3

Selecting elements of a vector that match any of a list of components is a very common data analysis task. For example, the gapminder data set contains `country` and `continent` variables, but no information between these two scales. Suppose we want to pull out information from southeast Asia: how do we set up an operation to produce a logical vector that is `TRUE` for all of the countries in southeast Asia and `FALSE` otherwise?

Suppose you have these data:

```{r}
seAsia <- c("Myanmar","Thailand","Cambodia","Vietnam","Laos")
## load the gapminder data that we introduced last week
library(gapminder)
data(gapminder)
## extract the `country` column from a data frame (we'll see this later);
## convert from a factor to a character;
## and get just the non-repeated elements
countries <- unique(as.character(gapminder$country))
```

Another way to do this, is using the `%>%` operator from the `magrittr` package, which I find much easier to read than cramming everything on a single line.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
countries <- gapminder$country %>% ## extract the `country` column from a data frame
  as.character() %>%               ## convert from a factor to a character;
  unique()                         ## and get just the non-repeated elements
```

There's a wrong way (using only `==`), which will give you a warning; a clunky way (using the logical operators `==` and `|`); and an elegant way (using `%in%`). See whether you can come up with all three and explain how they (don't) work.

<!-- Challenge 3 answer begin -->

```{r}
# wrong way to subset `countries`
# clunky way to subset `countries`
# elegant way to subset `countries`
```

<!-- Challenge 3 answer end -->

#### Challenge 4

Given the following code:

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:18, nrow=3, ncol=6)
print(m)
```

Which of the following commands will extract the values 11 and 14?

A. `m[2,4,2,5]`

B. `m[2:5]`

C. `m[4:5,2]`

D. `m[2,c(4,5)]`

<!-- Challenge 4 answer begin -->

A, B, C, or D?

<!-- Challenge 4 answer end -->

#### Challenge 5

Given the following code:

```{r}
xlist <- list(a = "Software Carpentry", b = 1:10, data = head(mtcars))
```

Using your knowledge of both list and vector subsetting, extract the number 2 from `xlist`. Hint: the number 2 is contained within the "b" item in the list.

<!-- Challenge 5 answer begin -->

```{r}
# your answer goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 5 answer end -->

#### Challenge 6

Given a linear model:

```{r}
mod <- aov(pop ~ lifeExp, data=gapminder)
```

Extract the residual degrees of freedom (hint: `attributes()` will help you)

<!-- Challenge 6 answer begin -->

```{r}
# your answer goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 6 answer end -->

#### Challenge 7

Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:

<!-- Challenge 7 answer begin -->

-   Extract observations collected for the year 1957

```{r}
gapminder[gapminder$year = 1957,]
```

-   Extract all columns except 1 through to 4

```{r}
gapminder[,-1:4]
```

-   Extract the rows where the life expectancy is longer the 80 years

```{r}
gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp > 80]
```

-   Extract the first row, and the fourth and fifth columns (`continent` and `lifeExp`).

```{r}
gapminder[1, 4, 5]
```

-   Advanced: extract rows that contain information for the years 2002 and 2007

```{r}
gapminder[gapminder$year == 2002 | 2007,]
```

<!-- Challenge 7 answer end -->

#### Challenge 8a

1.  Why does `gapminder[1:20]` return an error? How does it differ from `gapminder[1:20, ]`?

<!-- Challenge 8a answer begin -->

<!-- Challenge 8a answer end -->

#### Challenge 8b

2.  Create a new `data.frame` called `gapminder_small` that only contains rows 1 through 9 and 19 through 23. You can do this in one or two steps.

<!-- Challenge 8b answer begin -->

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 8b answer end -->
