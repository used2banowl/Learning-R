## Key Points

-   Use vectroized options instead of loops
:::

```{r}
library(gapminder)
data(gapminder)

library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
theme_set(theme_cowplot())

library(magrittr)
```

#### Challenge 1

Make a new column in the `gapminder` data frame that contains population in units of millions of people. Check the head or tail of the data frame to make sure it worked.

<!-- Challenge 1 answer begin -->

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 1 answer end -->

#### Challenge 2a

On a single graph, plot population, in millions, against year, for all countries. Do not worry about identifying which country is which.

<!-- Challenge 2a answer begin -->

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 2a answer end -->

#### Challenge 2b

Repeat the exercise, graphing only for China, India, and Indonesia. Again, do not worry about which is which.

<!-- Challenge 2b answer begin -->

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 2b answer end -->

#### Challenge 3

Given the following matrix:

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)
m
```

Write down what you think will happen when you run:

-   `m ^ -1`
-   `m * c(1, 0, -1)`
-   `m > c(0, 20)`
-   `m * c(1, 0, -1, 2)`

Did you get the output you expected? If not and the video didn't clear things up, let me know and we can discuss.

<!-- Challenge 3 answer begin -->

Your answer goes here.

<!-- Challenge 3 answer end -->

#### Challenge 4a

We're interested in looking at the sum of the following sequence of fractions:

```         
x = 1/(1^2) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^2) + ... + 1/(n^2)
```

This would be tedious to type out, and impossible for high values of $n$. Use vectorization to compute $x$ when $n=100$.

<!-- Challenge 4a answer begin -->

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 4a answer end -->

#### Challenge 4b

What is the sum when $n=10,000$?

<!-- Challenge 4b answer begin -->

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

<!-- Challenge 4b answer end -->
