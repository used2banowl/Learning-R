## Key Points

-   Use `cbind()` to add a new column to a data frame.
-   Use `rbind()` to add a new row to a data frame.
-   Remove rows from a data frame.
-   Use `na.omit()` to remove rows from a data frame with NA values.
-   Use `levels()` and `as.character()` to explore and manipulate factors.
-   Use `str()`, `summary()`, `nrow()`, `ncol()`, `dim()`, `colnames()`, `rownames()`, `head()`, and `typeof()` to understand the structure of a data frame.
-   Read in a csv file using `read.csv()`.
-   Understand what `length()` of a data frame represents.

#### Challenge 1

Let's imagine that 1 cat year is equivalent to 7 human years.

1.  Create a vector called `human_age` by multiplying `cats$age` by 7.
2.  Convert `human_age` to a factor.
3.  Convert `human_age` back to a numeric vector using the `as.numeric()` function. Now divide it by 7 to get the original ages back. Explain what happened.

<!-- Challenge 1 answer begin -->

```{r}
# load cats data (make sure you are in the correct working directory)
cats <- read.csv('../04-Data-Structures/data/feline-data_v2.csv')
cats$weight[4] <- 2.35
cats$weight <- as.numeric(cats$weight)
cats$age <- c(2,3,5,1)

# create human_age
## your code goes here

# convert human_age to a factor
## your code goes here

# convert human_age back to a numeric vector
## your code goes here
```

#### Challenge 2

You can create a new data frame right from within R with the following syntax:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(id = c("a", "b", "c"),
                 x = 1:3,
                 y = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE))
```

Make a data frame that holds the following information for yourself:

-   first name
-   last name
-   lucky number

Then use `rbind` to add an entry for someone you work with. Finally, use `cbind` to add a column with each person's answer to the question, "Is it time for coffee break?"

<!-- Challenge 2 answer begin -->

```{r}
# create people
people <- ## your code goes here ##
  
# add a team member
## your code goes here ##
  
# add coffee break
## your code goes here ##
  
people
```

<!-- Challenge 2 answer end -->

#### Challenge 3

It's good practice to also check the last few lines of your data and some in the middle. How would you do this?

Searching for observations specifically in the middle isn't too hard, but we could ask for a few lines at random. How would you code this?

<!-- Challenge 3 answer begin -->

```{r}
library(gapminder)
data(gapminder)

# your commands go here
```

<!-- Challenge 3 answer end -->

#### Challenge 4

Go to file -\> new file -\> R script, and write an R script to load in the gapminder dataset. Put it in the `scripts/` directory and add it to version control.

Run the script using the `source` function, using the file path as its argument.

<!-- Challenge 4 answer begin -->

```{r}
# load gapminder by sourcing your script here
```

<!-- Challenge 4 answer end -->

#### Challenge 5

Read the output of `str(gapminder)` again; this time, use what you've learned about factors, lists and vectors, as well as the output of functions like `colnames` and `dim` to explain what everything that `str` prints out for `gapminder` means.

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

<!-- Challenge 5 answer begin -->

Explain the output of `str(gapminder)` here.
