### [Seeking Help](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/03-seeking-help/index.html)

::: callout-tip
## Key Points

Use `help()` or `?` to get help in R.
:::

#### Challenge 1

Look at the help page for `c`. What kind of vector do you expect will be created if you evaluate the following?

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3)
c('d', 'e', 'f')
c(1, 2, 'f')
```

#### Challenge 2

Look at the help for the `paste` function. You will need to use it later. What's the difference between the `sep` and `collapse` arguments?

#### Challenge 3

Use help to find a function (and its associated parameters) that you could use to load data from a tabular file in which columns are delimited with "\t\" (tab) and the decimal point is a"." (period). This check for decimal separator is important, especially if you are working with international colleagues, because different countries have different conventions for the decimal point (i.e. comma vs period).

# Hint

Use `??"read table"` to look up functions related to reading in tabular data.
