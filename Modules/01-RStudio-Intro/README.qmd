## Key Points

-   Use RStudio to write and run R programs.
-   R has the usual arithmetic operators and mathematical functions.
-   Use `<-` to assign values to variables.
-   Use `ls()` to list the variables in a program.
-   Use `rm()` to delete objects in a script.
-   Use `install.packages()` to install packages and `library()` to load them.

#### Challenge 1

Which of the following are valid R variable names?

    min_height
    max.height
    _age
    .mass
    MaxLength
    min-length
    2widths
    celsius2kelvin

-   Valid
-   Invalid

#### Challenge 2

What will be the value of each variable after each statement in the following lines of code?

```{r}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
```

#### Challenge 3

Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to compare `mass` to `age`. Is mass larger than age?

```{r}
# comparison code goes here
```

#### Challenge 4

Clean up your working environment by deleting the mass and age variables.

```{r}
# code goes here
```

#### Challenge 5

Install the following packages: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `gapminder`

```{r}
# this will fail if the required packages are not installed
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
```
