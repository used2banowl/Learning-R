## Key Points

-   Use RStudio to write and run R programs.
-   R has the usual arithmetic operators and mathematical functions.
-   Use `<-` to assign values to variables.
-   Use `ls()` to list the variables in a program.
-   Use `rm()` to delete objects in a script.
-   Use `install.packages()` to install packages and `library()` to load them.

#### Challenge 1

Which of the following are valid R variable names?

```         
min_height
max.height
_age
.mass
MaxLength
min-length
2widths
celsius2kelvin
```

<!-- Challenge 1 answer begin -->

-   Valid
    -   min_height
    -   min.height
    -   .mass
    -   MaxLength
    -   celsius2kelvin
-   Invalid
    -   \_age
    -   min-length
    -   2widths

<!-- Challenge 1 answer end -->

#### Challenge 2

What will be the value of each variable after each statement in the following lines of code?

```{r}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
```

<!-- Challenge 2 answer begin -->

`mass = 109.25`

`age = 102`

<!-- Challenge 2 answer end -->

#### Challenge 3

Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to compare `mass` to `age`. Is mass larger than age?

<!-- Challenge 3 answer begin -->

```{r}
mass > age
```

<!-- Challenge 3 answer end -->

#### Challenge 4

Clean up your working environment by deleting the mass and age variables.

<!-- Challenge 4 answer begin -->

```{r}
rm(mass)
rm(age)
```

<!-- Challenge 4 answer end -->

#### Challenge 5

Install the following packages: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `gapminder`

<!-- Challenge 5 answer begin -->

```{r}
# this will fail if the required packages are not installed
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
```

<!-- Challenge 5 answer end -->
