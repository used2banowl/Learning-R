## Key Points

-   Use the `tidyr` package to change the layout of data frames.

-   Use `pivot_longer()` to go from wide to longer layout.

-   Use `pivot_wider()` to go from long to wider layout.

```{r}
#| include: false
library(gapminder)
data(gapminder)

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
```

#### Challenge 1

Is gapminder a purely long, purely wide, or some intermediate format?

<!-- Challenge 1 answer begin -->

<!-- Challenge 1 answer end -->

#### gap_wide vs gap_long vs gapminder

The `gap_wide` data set is formatted such that there is only one row per country.

```{r}
library(readr)
gap_wide <- read_csv('https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/data/gapminder_wide.csv')
gap_wide
```

The `gap_long` data set is formatted such that there is one row per data point.

```{r}
gap_long <- gap_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(starts_with('pop'), 
             starts_with('lifeExp'),
             starts_with('gdpPercap')),
    names_to = "obstype_year", 
    values_to = "obs_values") %>%
    
    separate(obstype_year, into = c('obstype', 'year'), sep = '_')
gap_long
```

Both formats cover the extreme ends of the spectrum of how we could format this in a tidy way. The intermediate format provided by `data(gapminder)` is probably more useful in most situations.

```{r}
gapminder
```

#### Challenge 2

Using `gap_long`, calculate the mean life expectancy, population, and gdpPercap for each continent. **Hint:** use the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions we learned in the `dplyr` lesson

<!-- Challenge 2 answer begin -->

```{r}
# insert code here
```

<!-- Challenge 2 answer end -->

#### Challenge 3

Create a `gap_ludicrously_wide` format data by pivoting over countries, year and the 3 metrics? **Hint** this new data frame should only have 5 rows.

<!-- Challenge 3 answer begin -->

```{r}
# insert code here
```
